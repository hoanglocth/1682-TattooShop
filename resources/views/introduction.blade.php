                the years, we have realized that tattooing art
                with modern machinery and equipment, high artistic and technical level is not enough. In order to be enough,
                there needs to be <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">conscientious</span> in each work, in every line
                of ink that we keep on you over the decades..</p>

                will be written by us as fully as possible with both enthusiasm and passion.</p>

                was born thousands of years ago. That is the commitment that we, collectively and individually, will be
                determined to bring to you.</p>

            <p></p>
